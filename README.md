# First-projects
First project or set of projets to get into some basics of programming.

Project 1:
Small program to evaluate a password that a user enters. It will give a score based on contents (uppercase, lowercase, number and special characters) and length. Second goal is to try to use a function to do the scoring of contents instead of a row of if statements. Third goal is to make it as effient as possible and of course in "good taste". Forth goal is to try to use Github while doing changes to get some experience with using it aswell as getting a habit of using version control.
