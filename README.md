# First-projects
First project or set of projets to get into some basics of programming.

Project 1: ratePassword:

Small program to evaluate a password that a user enters. It will give a score based on contents (uppercase, lowercase, number and special characters) and length.

Project 2: guessNumber:

Small program that generates a number that you can guess. Possible extentions to this program could be the ability to select the range or select the number of guesses.

Project 3: slotMachine:

A slot machine based on a youtube tutorial video, it seems like a really shitty slot machine and I did plan to try to improve it but I realized I don't know how
slow machines work so I need to learn that first!
